# QR Code Generator

## Overview
The QR Code Generator is a versatile and efficient tool designed to encode key/value pairs into QR codes. This utility focuses on storing alphanumeric data, leveraging the compact and robust nature of QR codes for information encoding and retrieval. 

## Features
- **Alphanumeric Data Support:** Specifically tailored to handle alphanumeric values, ensuring a wide range of data can be effectively encoded.
- **Optimized Data Capacity:** While QR codes can theoretically hold up to 2300 bytes, our generator optimally balances data capacity with scan reliability, ensuring quick and error-free scanning experiences.

## Use Cases
- Ideal for applications requiring the compact storage of simple data structures, such as key/value pairs.
- Useful in scenarios where quick data retrieval is essential, and the data footprint needs to be minimized.

## Technical Specifications
- **Data Type:** Alphanumeric (digits, uppercase letters, and some punctuation marks).
- **Maximum Capacity:** Up to 2300 bytes, subject to the constraints of QR code version and error correction level used.

## Applications
This QR Code Generator is particularly suitable for:
- Business: Encoding website URLs, contact information, or promotional details.
- Personal Use: Storing Wi-Fi access credentials, personal identifiers, or quick access to online profiles.
- Event Management: Embedding ticketing information, event details, or location coordinates.

## User Guide
- To begin, simply input your key/value pairs.

## Security Note
As with any data encoding tool, users are advised to be cautious about the information they encode, especially sensitive or personal data. QR codes generated by this tool should be treated with the same level of security as the information they contain.
